/**
 * Base class that defines client operations for managing orchestration instances.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class can be used to start, query, raise events to, and terminate orchestration instances.
 * In most cases, methods on this class accept an instance ID as a parameter, which identifies the orchestration
 * instance.</p>
 *
 * <p>At the time of writing, the most common implementation of this class is <code>DurableTaskGrpcClient</code>,
 * which works by making gRPC calls to a remote service (e.g. a sidecar) that implements the operation behavior. To
 * ensure any owned network resources are properly released, instances of this class should be closed when they are no
 * longer needed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are expected to be safe for multithreaded apps. You can therefore safely cache instances
 * of this class and reuse them across multiple contexts. Caching these objects is useful to improve overall
 * performance.</p>
