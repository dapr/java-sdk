["Hello, world!",
  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
  "If a tree falls in the forest and there is no one there to hear it, does it make a sound?",
  "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.",
  "Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else."]
